# Unofficial RIT Discord Bot
Hal is the bot that helps with managing the RIT discord server. It provides tools for the staff of the server to do moderation, and a few fun tools for the users.

Additionally, it includes some useful tools like a course browser, bus arrival time estimator, and something to see what places to eat are open on campus.
